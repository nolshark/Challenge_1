# Challenge_1
The motivation behind this project was to make the website more accessible to the public and people who may be visually challenged, or auditorially challenged. I built this project because making sure webpages are accessible by everyone and useable by everyone is a very important part to making sure that a website gets displayed higher on a search engine. This randition of the program made it more accessible to the general public because prior to this update, there was no accessibility added. I learned from this project that it is important to make sure to add ease of use to a website and make sure that everyone can access your website. I also learned that it is important to make sure to make your code simple and clean, so that it is easier to read.
